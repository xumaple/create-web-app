# Create-Web-App
This is a small script which helps you to set up a basic React web application. 

# How to use

Download `create-web-app`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/xumaple/create-web-app && cd create-web-app
```
And install it:
```sh
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Or, alternatively, use the `install` script (which does the same thing): 
```sh
$ chmod +x ./install
$ ./install
```

That's it! You can now run the `create-web-app` command from anywhere on your terminal to create a React web app. 

```sh
$ create-web-app -v <project-name> <project destination>
```

(the `-v` flag is optional and provides verbose output.)
